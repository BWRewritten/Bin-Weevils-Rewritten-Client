# Cozy Penguin Desktop
This is the web-based client for Cozy Penguin, solving the problem of Flash ending support in 2020, resulting in obtaining and using Flash harder. This client has many functions, including:
- Automatically clearing the users' cache when the application is launched (parties and features update instantly!)
- Discord Rich Presence support. Have a shiny Discord status when playing
- Embedded (Pepper) Flash Player. There's no need to install Flash manually.
- Automatic client updates to add new fuctionality

This is heavily inspired by Penguin World's client. We reccommend creating a separate play page, eg (https://play.cozypenguin.net/desktop) so that Flash is fullscreen.
